remove the filepath on the panel and add initialize operator, this initialize operator will creates .gitblend collection and rename the existing collection to main and copy the existing collection into .gitblend

i need a system to check for changes made when committing,

this change validation should be like this:
check if the commit contains the name of the previous commit
check if each matching name data has the same transform data
check if each matching name has the same origin position
check if each matching name object has the same bounding box height and weight
check if each matching name object has the same vertex count
check if each matching name object the same vertex groups
check if each matching name object the same uv data
check if each matching name object the same shapekeys data
check if each matching name contains identical modifiers
check if each matching name object vertices has matching index and their vertices has identical world position


make sure to create early exits, don't duplicate the data into .gitblend if the match is the same. The check should be ordered from the least requiring processing resources. I might miss some important validation concept, propose to me if you have ideas

results

Checklist of your requirements
Check if the commit contains the name of the previous commit: Done (current must contain all previous names).
Check same transform data: Done (matrix_world).
Check same origin position: Done (world translation).
Check same bounding box height/width: Done (dimensions vector).
Check same vertex count: Done (mesh vertex count).
Check same vertex groups: Done (names + per-vertex weights).
Check same UV data: Done (layer count/names + per-loop UV coords).
Check same shapekeys data: Done (count/names + values + per-point coords).
Check identical modifiers: Done (type/name/stack order).
Check vertices index + identical world position: Done (per-vertex world coords).
Early exits and skip duplicate snapshot in .gitblend: Done (ordered checks, skip when identical).
Actions taken
Implemented a validation system in validate.py:
Snapshot metadata: store gitblend_orig_name on duplicated objects/collections.
Matching: compare objects by original names (not the suffixed snapshot names).
Ordered, early-exit checks:
Name set equality
Transform (matrix_world) and origin translation
Bounding-box dimensions
Vertex count
Modifiers (type/name/stack)
Vertex group names
UV layer meta (count/names)
Shapekey meta (count/names)
UV per-loop coords
Shapekey values and point counts
Vertex weights per group
Vertex world positions
Shapekey per-point coordinates (non-Basis; most expensive)
Cheap pre-check: ensure current contains all previous names.
API added:
get_latest_snapshot(scene, branch)
collections_identical(curr, prev) -> (bool, reason)
should_skip_commit(scene, curr, branch) -> (skip, reason)
Wired validation into GITBLEND_OT_commit:
If identical to last snapshot for the selected branch, don’t duplicate into .gitblend and report: “No changes detected (…); skipping snapshot”.
Stored original names during duplication to enable robust matching across commits.
